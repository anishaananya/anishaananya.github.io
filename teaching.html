      <p class="mb-2">
        We volunteer at <strong>Chudar</strong>, an Indian nonprofit providing free quality education to under-resourced students through after-school programs. 
        Our work focuses on improving math skills for K–12 learners in low-income communities.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        We’ve taught weekly two-hour classes for groups of 30+ students preparing for India’s <em>National Means-Cum-Merit Scholarship Exam</em>, 
        which awards financial aid to high-achieving students from low-income families. Over 50% of students passed under our mentorship.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        We also built <strong>MathBuddy</strong>, an offline Android app that lets students learn and practice math individually using curated question banks.

      <p class="mb-2">
        The <strong>Dougherty Math Circle</strong> is a student-led nonprofit engaging students from 10+ schools in advanced math and data science through problem-solving sessions, workshops, and competition prep.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        As <strong>Curriculum Developers</strong>, we’ve designed problem sets and taught 50+ elementary and middle schoolers preparing for math contests. 
        As <strong>Heads of AI</strong>, we launched a 6-week AI and Math workshop for 30 students, integrating coding and analytics into math problem solving.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Now as <strong>Presidents</strong>, we lead outreach and curriculum teams, connecting with local schools and expanding access to enrichment programs.

    InSight: AI-based retinal disease screening tool (June 2025)
  </h2>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
    <li>
      <strong>Developed InSight, an AI-based screening tool aimed at improving early detection of five major eye diseases: age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, and pathological myopia. </strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      These conditions collectively affect over 782 million people worldwide, yet access to screening remains limited in middle and low-income countries.
    </li>
    <li>
      Because many of these diseases are asymptomatic in their early stages, patients often miss the window for treatment. Currently, over 90% of the world’s blind population lives in lower-income regions.
    </li>
    <li>
      InSight integrates patient metadata with fundus images to enable accurate, real-time diagnosis through a three-stage pipeline:
      (1) Image Quality Assessment Model,
      (2) Multimodal Five-Disease Diagnosis Model,
      (3) Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Grading.
    </li>
    <li>
      The multitask model demonstrated strong generalizability across varied imaging conditions (lab-captured and mobile-captured fundus images) while detecting five diseases simultaneously.
    </li>
    <li>
      These results highlight InSight’s potential as a lightweight, accessible AI screening tool adaptable to both clinical and mobile-based applications.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>We presented our work on InSight and won first place at the county science fair, invited to the California Science & Engineering Fair (top 15 projects out of ~350 in Alameda County), and recognized with the “Outstanding AI Innovation” Award.</strong>

    MetaFusion: Multimodal Data Fusion Algorithm (Apr 2025)
  </h2>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
    <li>
      <strong>We developed MetaFusion, a novel multimodal fusion algorithm to combine clinical data with imaging data.</strong>
      Our method shows superior performance for skin cancer classification (from smartphone images),
      breast cancer detection (from X-ray mammograms), and glaucoma detection (from retinal fundus images).
    </li>
    <li>
      In low-resource settings where medical data are often fragmented or incomplete, data fusion is essential for combining multiple modalities of data — such as imaging and patient metadata — to support accurate diagnosis.
    </li>
    <li>
      Our method is parameter-efficient and demonstrates consistent performance across three diseases.
    </li>

      <strong>Our paper on MetaFusion was accepted for presentation at the IEEE International Symposium of Biomedical Imaging 2025.</strong>

      Carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) is a subset of metastatic cancers in which the primary source of the cancer cells remains unidentified.
      It is the eighth most common malignancy worldwide, accounting for up to 5% of all cancers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Lack of knowledge of the tissue of origin makes it difficult to devise tailored and effective treatments for patients with CUP.
